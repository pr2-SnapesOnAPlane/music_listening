# Project 2 Description

We will analyze music sales data to see which artists have contributed the most to their genre's popularity. Data has been sampled and scraped from the RIAA certification website, and genres for each artist referenced by the RIAA site have been queried via the Discogs API. The sample pulls from the highest 2336 RIAA certifications. We have built an interactive chart that will show the certifications by genre, then by artist, then by album for each artist. There is also a filter to change by the format, due to the recent popularity of streaming services, from album to single.
